# Experiments — RL teachers

Use a unique run ID, record the hypothesis and config change before launch, then append results and promotion decisions. Never overwrite failed or weaker trials. Planned budgets below are not running jobs.

| ID | Task/scope | Purpose | Budget | Status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PREFLIGHT-CFG-001 | All 24 | Check registered interface/PPO/physics | Read-only configs | Complete | 60D/8D; eight zero-gravity presets; all default num_envs=1 |
| PREFLIGHT-GPU-001 | dgx1/holder20277 | Availability and assignment | Snapshot | Complete | GPUs1–3 assigned and idle; no experiment steps at snapshot |
| PREFLIGHT-PPO-001 | Reach | Real optimization + checkpoint round trip | 64 envs × 24 steps × 2 updates | Complete | 3,072 transitions; finite losses; parameters changed; reload and optimizer restore passed; no success evaluation |
| PREFLIGHT-CLI-001 | Launcher | UUID pinning compatibility | No training | Complete | Generic selector fails; direct runner works; stage-local launcher dry-run validated |
| EVAL-001 | Evaluator | Strict first-episode checkpoint evaluation | Targeted checks | Planned | No evaluator certification yet |
| RL-001 | Reach | First full training/evaluation pilot | Proposed: 1,024 envs, 500 iterations, seed20260912 | Planned | Not launched |
| RL-002 | Lift | Learn grasp + lift with common interface | Proposed: same initial pilot budget | Planned | Not launched |
| REWARD-001 | Mechanisms | Recover useful reset-to-contact reward signal | Define after curve review | Planned | Not launched |
| INIT-001 | Cage | Keep valid open cage during initial exploration | Define open-gripper prior/curriculum | Planned | Not launched |
| COMPLETE-001 | Stack/Peg/Place | Align dense return and strict completion | Define after reward review | Planned | Not launched |

## Run record template

- ID, task, hypothesis, status, start/end UTC, Slurm step, GPU UUID.
- Training seed, environment count, iterations/transitions, interface version, source/config hashes, reward and physics changes.
- Checkpoint and normalizer path/hash, losses, reward components, action saturation, termination counts, throughput and measured GPU memory.
- Strict successes/trials, evaluation seeds, deterministic/stochastic policy mode, episode budget, first-episode accounting, videos.
- Decision: retain/reject/continue, why, and next experiment. A teacher is certified only by the GOAL.md criterion.
