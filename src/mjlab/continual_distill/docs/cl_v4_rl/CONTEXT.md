# Context — read before resuming

**New agents:** follow [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) to create an isolated worktree and ensure Python imports that worktree.

## User decisions

1. Next phase is RL teacher training: **one teacher per task**, target **>90% success for every task**.
2. Preserve the working common **60D observation layout**, including its useful redundancy. The provisional 143D schema was rejected.
3. Keep normalized, bounded **8D absolute joint-position actions**, identical across tasks: seven arm targets span physical joint limits; gripper -1/0/+1 means closed/half-open/open.
4. Tool-Pull is excluded for now, leaving **24 active tasks**. Do not delete its environment, assets, registry entry, teacher code or historical results.
5. This setup pass checks readiness and prepares tracking files. It performed only a two-update PPO plumbing smoke, not full teacher training.

## Sources of truth

- Active suite: `mjlab.tasks.manipulation.benchmark.active_cl_tasks()`; snapshot: `active_tasks.json`. Do not enumerate the full registry or old 25-task result folders for a new suite run.
- Interface: `src/mjlab/tasks/manipulation/franka_interface.py`, version `franka_shared_60_v2`; details in `../cl_v3/shared_60/README.md`.
- Current registered configs: `evidence/preflight.json`. Registry finalization applies the shared interface; use `load_env_cfg`, not raw base builders.
- Prior reward audit: `../cl_v3/rl_readiness/README.md`. Its old action/observation findings are superseded; its reward and physics findings remain relevant.
- Prior numerical checks: `../cl_v3/shared_60/verification.json` (historically all 25, including the now-deferred task). 24 active environments passed; teacher comparisons passed for those 24.
- Source at preflight: git HEAD `b9b0563bd7b1b9cdcf9a369668c3b0c163e2fd72` plus a substantial pre-existing dirty worktree. HEAD alone is insufficient to reproduce it. Source hashes and dirty paths are saved in preflight evidence; archive the actual code/patch and assets for real experiments. Do not discard others' edits.

## Observations

Order: joint position 9, joint velocity 9, object position 3, object quaternion 4, gripper position 3, gripper rotation 6, object rotation 6, gripper-to-object 3, object-to-goal 3, goal-orientation difference 6, control error 8. Joint quantities use legacy physical/default-relative units. Absolute-position fields subtract scene origins. Actor/critic receive identical clean state; PPO running normalization remains enabled.

No extra tool/fixture/contact/history/velocity channels. Reach uses a virtual object at its target. Stack/Peg destination information is in the goal vector. Compact-state limitations are intentional; first test learning instead of expanding the schema automatically. Old neural checkpoints still require action-unit conversion; 143D checkpoints are incompatible.

## Compute and tooling

### Current continuation overrides (2026-09-12)

Worktree: `/ihub/homedirs/svs_ald/sudhir/mjlab-rl-teachers-24-codex`, branch `exp/rl-teachers-24-codex`, base `4149157`. User expanded the allocation to GPU indices **1–7**, leaving GPU0 unused. The older GPUs1–3 snapshot below is historical. Continue to check actual placement and use holder20277 only.

W&B is now verified under entity **`sudhirpratapyadav-indian-institute-of-technology-jodhpur`**, project **`mjlab-cl24-rl-teachers-20260912`**. The shorter profile name is not the team's entity namespace. `wandb_config.py` scopes credential/configuration to this experiment process. The private credential lives outside the repository at `~/.config/mjlab-cl24/wandb_api_key`. Never print it or call global `wandb login`. `evidence/wandb_destination.json` records a successful remote write/read and unchanged shared settings. Training was paused until this check passed; that W&B blocker is now resolved. Original pilot imports are recorded in `evidence/wandb_pilot_imports.json`.

Follow `~/use_instructions/README.md`. Existing holder **20277**, name **hold_dgx_amit**, node **dgx1**. Historical initial assignment was indices1–3; the current user authorization is indices1–7. Never cancel another user's holder or processes. Recheck actual process placement before each launch.

At 2026-09-12 14:30 UTC, all eight A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs showed 0 MiB use and no compute processes. The holder had only its batch step. Slurm reports expiration **2026-09-28T08:58:54** (scheduler time). The filesystem had about **1.6 TB free, 95% used**; plan checkpoint/video retention.

Assigned UUIDs:
- GPU1: `GPU-2496e2db-e138-0dec-41fc-27d2535b6e86`
- GPU2: `GPU-23a5dcb4-5248-01aa-94a3-d0f998660161`
- GPU3: `GPU-fd08a1c1-caff-efc7-e4e6-e1117772f9fc`

Export the UUID **inside** the Slurm step; set `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`. The generic `launch_training` GPU selector parses visible devices as integers and fails on UUIDs (`evidence/launcher_probe.json`). The stage-local `train_teacher.py` bypasses GPU reselection and calls `run_train` directly on the already pinned `cuda:0`. Its full training/checkpoint/config-saving path has been exercised by the retained teachers.

Use `.venv/bin/python`. Package versions are saved in preflight evidence. PPO smoke uses local TensorBoard logging, avoiding an external logging dependency. Stage-local runs default to online W&B in the verified project.

## Current outcome and next action

**16/24 independent PPO RL teachers certified.** Cage19092 is newest at119/128 validation and120/128 prospectively frozen confirmation20260916. Its actual videos, all-episode no-pinch aperture audit, finite checkpoint and13-file W&B teacher artifact are verified. Place7500 remains117/128+119/128. Throw9496 failed confirmation107/128 and remains uncertified.

Current full runs: ReorientR12 GPU1 final14595, ThrowR7 GPU2 final14098, LiftR13 GPU4 final17992, StackR9 GPU5 final12195 and EdgeR5 GPU7 final10995. Five actual process placements and eight-CPU affinities verified in training_wave30.json; GPUs3/6 are free after completed Strike/Peg evaluations. GPU0 remains unused. Holder20277 expires2026-09-28T08:58:54 scheduler time.

Latest completed strict validations: ThrowR6 110/128, StackR8 2/128, StrikeR7 39/128, PegR8 0/128. Actual clips reviewed; none pass the116 gate, so no confirmation or new certificate. Throw native/GPU recorded-control replay isolates box-floor angular settling; existing opt-in primitive compatibility passes18-case replay, native parity tests and64x3/2048x100 finite preflights before fullR7. Stack transport improves but gripper mean saturates; mean-only initialization reset passes64x3 and bounded-reset tests before fullR9, retaining learned std. Pivot staged diagnostic arrival develops upward force and median10.56deg tilt, below20deg; no new Pivot training recipe. Native success, physical models and60D/8D remain fixed.
